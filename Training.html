    <h1>Training</h1>
    <h3>Training is the most important part of the gym and a good training goes with the good trainer. </h3>
    <p>Classes are great for giving you new ideas for workouts, but they can’t always help you move forward with bespoke goals. For this, you might need to work with a personal trainer.

        Personal trainers are fitness professionals who work with clients to create custom workouts and provide advice during exercise.
        
        What can a personal trainer help with??
        
        Reaching an ideal weight
        Developing strength
        Rehabilitation after an injury
        Improve their performance in a particular sport
        Personal trainers usually aren’t covered in the standard membership fee. However, many gym members find it’s worth the cost of even just a few sessions when you’re starting out because it sets you out on the right path, meaning your workouts are more effective going forward. Personal trainers will also keep you accountable to your goals, preventing you from slowly drifting away from your routine.
        
        Gym staff will usually set up a brief ‘meet and greet’ with your personal trainer so you can get to know their training style and they can learn what it is you want to achieve</p>
